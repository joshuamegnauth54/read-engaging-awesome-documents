# READ: READ Engaging, Awesome Documents
I've encountered many excellent resources on programming, data, math, and other technical subjects that I've kept scattered across bookmarks and text documents.
Maintaining my lists is a **pain** with little benefit as I've lost them many times regardless. Oops.

Everyone seems to be uploading excellent lists of excellence these days, so I thought I should hop on that bandwagon as well!
The resources in my lists are not the best resources per topic total but simply articles and books that I enjoy. Furthermore, inclusion
does not imply that I've fully read the material. Some of the resources look _great_ so I _shall_ get to them later.

I tend to link many of the statistics resources (such as the myriad R and Python texts) to colleagues. I've used chapters from some of
these texts in class despite not reading through them fully yet. So, I can say that many of these texts are not random and untested, at least.

The [lists](https://github.com/joshuamegnauth54/read-engaging-awesome-documents/blob/main/awesome_docs.md) are incomplete, disorganized, and woefully inadequate.
Feel free to suggest resources as fit.
