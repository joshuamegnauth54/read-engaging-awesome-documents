# READ: READ Engaging, Awesome Documents
I've encountered many excellent resources on programming, data, math, and other technical subjects that I've kept scattered across bookmarks and text documents. Maintaining my lists is a **pain** with little benefit as I've lost them many times regardless. Oops.

Everyone seems to be uploading excellent lists of excellence these days, so I thought I should hop on that bandwagon as well!

The [list](https://github.com/joshuamegnauth54/read-engaging-awesome-documents/blob/main/awesome_docs.md) is incomplete, disorganized, and woefully inadequate.
